{
    name: "Repository-Name",
    description: "Repository description...",
    stars: 0,
    forks: 0,
    language: "Python",
    topics: ["topic1", "topic2"],

}
```

### Updating Statistics
The hero section statistics are automatically calculated from the repository data. To update manually, modify the hero stats in `index.html`.

:root {
    --primary-color: #6366f1;
